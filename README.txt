Genetic stock identification data from the Hakai Institute Juvenile Salmon Program

## Summary

A subset of juvenile sockeye salmon collected by the JSP are assigned a probability of originating from a freshwater system using genetic stock identification conducted at the Molecular Genetics Lab at the Pacific Biological Station in Nanaimo, BC. 

## Folders

Two folders exist for samples that have been analyzed against different genetic baselines. 'coastwide040118.bse baseline results' folder contains the most years of data. The 'coastwide
baseline results contains only results from 2022 and 2023 that used a smaller baseline to be comparable with the Pacific Salmon Commissions standard for in-season analyses.

## Files

The "all_years_combined_individual_ids.csv" file contains all years of available GSI data from the Hakai JSP using the coastwide040118 baseline.

"mskHAKAI_####_2022-##-##.xlsx" files are the component child files for each run of data through the stock ID software (CBAYES) that were combined to produce the 'combined_GSI.xlsx' file.

"DNA Backgrounder...doc" file contains information on how to interpret results as well as methods used.

## Methods

This is done in the molecular genetics lab at Fisheries and Oceans Canada's Pacific Biological Station.
